# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination progress. Using the [Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv), the project creates visualizations (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and choropleth maps) to illustrate key metrics and derive actionable insights. The analysis is presented in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook, combining code, visualizations, and narrative explanations.

## Objectives
- Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths over time using line charts.
- Visualize vaccination progress across selected countries with line and bar charts.
- Create a choropleth map to display case density by country.
- Summarize key insights and identify patterns or anomalies in the data.
- Deliver a reproducible Jupyter Notebook report that is easy to read and share.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Static visualizations (line charts, bar charts).
- **seaborn**: Enhanced visualizations with aesthetic styling (bar charts, heatmaps).
- **Plotly Express**: Interactive choropleth map for geospatial visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for combining code, visualizations, and narrative.
- **Optional**: Streamlit (for interactive dashboard, described in notebook).
